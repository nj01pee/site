# Debunked

This is a list of the most common arguments used in different lists on anti vaccination pages around the internet.

> In 1871-2, England, with 98% of the population aged between 2 and 50 vaccinated against smallpox, it experienced its worst ever smallpox outbreak with 45,000 deaths. During the same period in Germany, with a vaccination rate of 96%, there were over 125,000 deaths from smallpox. ([The Hadwen Documents](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_vacunas24.htm))

"The Hadwen Documents" that are refered to are found on another page on the same site, [http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_vacunas24.htm](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_vacunas24.htm). They contain several texts by, mainly, [Walter Hadwen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hadwen). Worth noting is that Walter Hadwen, despite being a doctor, was opposed to the germ theory of disease as well as a very outspoken anti vaccination activist.

98% kommer från ett uttalande av
45'000 kommer från stycket "THE TEACHING OF EXPERIENCE" och är där angivet som 44'800.
125'000 kommer från stycket "THE HISTORY OF SMALL-POX IN GERMANY" och är där angiven som 124'979.


>  Although this epidemic of smallpox was one of the severest on record in this country, the annual average death-rate in prevaccination times was more than three times the death-rate of the epedemic of the seventies. Seaton illustrates this statement by the fact that the estimated annual smallpox death-rate in England in the eighteenth century was 3,000 per million of the population, while the mean annual death-rate of the 1871-72 epidemic was 928 per million, being 1,024 in 1871 and 833 per million in 1872. A comparison of the mortality of the 1870-73 epidemic with the previous great epidemic of the century in 1837-40 shows that the proportionate mortality of the later epidemic was less than two-thirds of the mortality of the 1837-40 epidemic.

> Easton (1945) records of one man who died of confluent smallpox that vaccination had been attempted at birth, again in 1941 and ten times in 1943 without a take, thus emphasizing the danger of accepting even repeated unsuccessful vaccination as evidence of insusceptibility to smallpox.

> In Germany, compulsory mass vaccination against diphtheria commenced in 1940, and by 1945, diphtheria cases were up from 40,000 to 250,000. ([Don't Get Stuck](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Get-Stuck-Hannah-Allen/dp/B00IACZMO4/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1400485855&sr=1-9), Hannah Allen)

Enligt den data som finns bevarad så gick difterifallen från 138,397 1940 till 238,409 1943, data för 1944 och 1945 saknas. Detta är en ökning med 72% mitt under brinnande krig. Enligt resten av siffrorna som ges i rapporten så ökade difteri i Danmark med 193% (från 860-2527), Frankrike 243% (13568-46539), Nederländerna 3171% (1730-56603), Norge >15000% (149-22787) och i Sverige, som inte var i krig, med 760% (290-2496). Med tanke på det så ser det mer ut som att vaccineringen i Tyskland, trots kriget, hade en märkbar effekt.

> The most interesting changes occurred in Germany, where diphtheria was endemic before World War II and where an alarming rise in the incidence of diphtheria was seen beginning in 1941 (table 2). Frequent references were made to the spread of malignant diphtheria in Germany in the early 1940s, the course of which was so rapid that serum therapy, even at a very early stage of disease development, had no effect [53, 58].

> As pointed out by Stowman [53], diphtheria was also an important cause of death in the German army, particularly as a complication of chest wounds and typhus.
