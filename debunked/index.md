# Debunked

This is a list of the most common arguments used in different lists on anti vaccination pages around the internet.

> In 1871-2, England, with 98% of the population aged between 2 and 50 vaccinated against smallpox, it experienced its worst ever smallpox outbreak with 45,000 deaths. During the same period in Germany, with a vaccination rate of 96%, there were over 125,000 deaths from smallpox. (The Hadwen Documents)

"The Hadwen Documents" that are refered to are found on another page on the same site, http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/salud/salud_vacunas24.htm. They contain several texts by, mainly, [Walter Hadwen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hadwen). Worth noting is that Walter Hadwen, despite being a doctor, was opposed to the germ theory of disease as well as a very outspoken anti vaccination activist.

While the author is using self refrencing in the first place what is worse is that the numbers 45'000 and 125'000 can not be found in the documents at all.

>  Although this epidemic of smallpox was one of the severest on record in this country, the annual average death-rate in prevaccination times was more than three times the death-rate of the epedemic of the seventies. Seaton illustrates this statement by the fact that the estimated annual smallpox death-rate in England in the eighteenth century was 3,000 per million of the population, while the mean annual death-rate of the 1871-72 epidemic was 928 per million, being 1,024 in 1871 and 833 per million in 1872. A comparison of the mortality of the 1870-73 epidemic with the previous great epidemic of the century in 1837-40 shows that the proportionate mortality of the later epidemic was less than two-thirds of the mortality of hte 1837-40 epidemic.

> Easton (1945) records of one man who died of confluent smallpox that vaccination had been attempted at birth, again in 1941 and ten times in 1943 without a take, thus emphasizing the danger of accepting even repeated unsuccessful vaccination as evidence of insusceptibility to smallpox.
