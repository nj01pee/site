# Welcome to vaccination.works

This site exists to help people that wants to argue for vaccintion againt the current wave of anti vaccination propaganda.

The use of the word propaganda here is not to insite anything, it's a statemant of fact. The formal definition of propaganda is this:

> Propaganda is information that is not impartial and used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively (thus possibly lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or using loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than rational response to the information presented.

As we will show this is exactly what is usually sent around on the social networks by anti vaccination supporters.



## Authors and Contributors

The authors behind this site is doing all the work of digging thru the research and reports used as sources by the anti vaccination supporters volontarily.

We belive that vaccination is a net good by a huge margin, but do not deny that it's not problem free. We want to help spread a balanced view on vaccination supported by facts so that people can make real decisions based on real information.

This page is only supported economically by my codeworks in that we use their Github account for these pages, it's public and you can contribute if you want to, and in that they pay for the domains that link here.

The authors are not part of any group or organization. We don't get payed and we don't get any monitary or material contributions or compensations for our work or to the site other than the hosting and domains.

We do this because it is important and because we think that if we can help people even a little it's worth a lot.
